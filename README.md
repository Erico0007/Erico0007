Hi Guys 
My name is Eric.  I’m interested in Programming languages as I am a beginner 
I’m currently learning  Java and SQL and will be  learning JavaScript as I am currently getting  a certificate in IT at the school of McGill University. 
I am looking to connect with new friends on this platform who can help me get better as I am a beginner.
