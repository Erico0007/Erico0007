Hi Guys 
My name is Eric, and I'm a beginner interested in programming languages. 
I'm currently learning Java and SQL, and I plan to study JavaScript next as well HTML and CSS.
I'm pursuing an IT certificate at McGill University and am eager to connect with others on this platform who can help me improve my skills.
